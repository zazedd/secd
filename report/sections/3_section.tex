\subsection{Optimizing \texttt{let} declarations}
The original compilation for the \texttt{let} declarations was as follows:
\[ C(\texttt{let x = M in N}) = C((\lambda x.N)M) \]

This creates an extra closure from the new application, which is not as efficient as it could be.
In fact, if we add a new instruction,

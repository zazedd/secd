\section{Conclusions}
The code is online at \href{https://github.com/zazedd/secd}{github.com/zazedd/secd}.

Weâ€™ve taken a deep dive into the SECD Machine, 
breaking down its structure, instruction set, and execution model. 
Along the way, we introduced optimizations that make it a bit more efficient, 
such as smarter \texttt{let} handling, combining the stack and the dump, 
and implementing tail call optimization to avoid stack overflows.
On top of that, we expanded the language's capabilities with features like tuples and basic variants, 
making the machine way more expressive, with little effort.

Ultimately, this work shows how the SECD Machine, despite its age, 
can be modernized and adapted to handle more complex language features 
while keeping things simple and elegant.

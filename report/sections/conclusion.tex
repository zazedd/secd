\section{Conclusions}
The code is online at \href{https://github.com/zazedd/secd}{github.com/zazedd/secd}.
We’ve outlined the structure and operation of the SECD Machine, from its data handling and instruction set to its compilation and interpretation processes. By implementing optimizations like streamlined let declarations, stack-dump unification, and tail call optimization, we improve both performance and memory efficiency. Additionally, extensions such as tuple support and untyped variants enhance the machine’s versatility. These improvements demonstrate how the SECD Machine can evolve to support more complex language features while maintaining its core simplicity.

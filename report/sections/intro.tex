\section{Introduction}
This paper explores the SECD Machine, a simple yet powerful abstract machine designed to evaluate expressions in functional programming languages. 
We start by defining its core data structures and instruction set, then break down the compilation and interpretation processes. From there, we introduce several key optimizations â€” including improved handling of let declarations, combining stack and dump structures, and tail call optimization.
Finally, we extend the machine to support new features like tuples and basic variants.
